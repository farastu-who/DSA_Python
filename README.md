## DSA_Python

### Description
This is a somewhat comprehensive study of Data Structures & Algorithms in Python. This is also the first topic being covered in the list of all the relevant Computer Science study materials. I am doing this since I didn't study CS in my undergrad nor did I do any bootcamps. But I am currently doing my Master's in CS and it has been a real struggle since I feel that there's a lot of gaps in my knowledge base, and rightly so.
